## 🔗 Token Specification (HTS)

**Overview:**  
AgroToken is a utility and reward token designed to power Agrochain's ecosystem on Hedera. It uses the Hedera Token Service (HTS) for minting, transferring, and burning.

### Token Details:

- **Token Name:** AgroToken  
- **Symbol:** AGRO  
- **Type:** Fungible Token (HTS)  
- **Decimals:** 2  
- **Initial Supply:** 1,000,000 AGRO  
- **Max Supply:** 10,000,000 AGRO (mintable)  
  **Treasury Account:** `0.0.9341135`
- **Admin Key:** Held by Agrochain Team  
- **Supply Key:** Controlled by Governance contract (future)

### Token Logic:

- **Minting:** Admin can mint up to max supply.

- **Transfer:** P2P and platform-based transfers enabled.

### Use Cases:

1. Rewarding farmers for verified produce  
2. Discount on agro inputs via partners  
3. Loyalty system for long-term users
