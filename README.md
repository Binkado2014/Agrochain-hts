# 🌾 AgroToken - Powered by Hedera HTS 🌿

AgroToken is a utility token built on the Hedera Token Service (HTS), designed to represent real agricultural value. It helps farmers tokenize harvests, inputs, and community support in a decentralized and verifiable way.

## 🔧 Features
- 🌱 HTS Token Creation (AgroToken)
- 🔁 Transfer Simulation / Distribution
- 🔐 Transparency in local cooperatives
- 📈 Expandable via EVM contracts

## 💡 How It Works
1. Farmers get AgroTokens for every harvest registered
2. Tokens can be used in the local market or redeemed
3. Future smart contracts will control rewards, savings, and loans

We are a grassroots tech-agro innovation team based in Katsina, Nigeria, committed to transforming agriculture through decentralized and inclusive technology. Our journey started with educating over 3,000 people about Web3 and Pi Network, and now we're expanding into practical tools using Hedera Hashgraph and other blockchain technologies.

The Agrochain project is a step forward in digitizing local agriculture, ensuring traceability, secure value exchange, and building economic bridges between farmers and the broader global ecosystem. We strongly believe in open-source collaboration, community empowerment, and building for real impact.

Our team combines local field experience with technical ambition — united under the belief that African agriculture deserves global-grade innovation.
