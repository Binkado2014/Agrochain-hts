# ðŸŒ¾ AgroChain Multichain (Hedera â†” Sonic)

AgroChain is evolving into a multichain ecosystem. We combine **Hedera HTS** for trusted agricultural tokenization with **Sonic** for scalable DeFi, marketplaces, and liquidityâ€”bridging value between the two.

## Vision  
Empower smallholder farmers with transparent, tokenized agricultural value and scalable access to markets and rewards by linking Hederaâ€™s low-fee tokenization with Sonicâ€™s high-throughput DeFi infrastructure.

## Problem  
Rural farmers need traceable value, reliable liquidity, and global market access. Single-chain solutions face limits in throughput or composability.

## Solution  
Deploy **AgroToken (AGRO)** on Hedera for native farming incentives, then **bridge** or represent that value on Sonic to enable:
- High-speed marketplaces  
- Yield-style rewards (DeFi)  
- Cross-chain dashboard and liquidity access  

## Architecture Overview

1. **Hedera HTS**: AgroToken issuance, farmer reward minting, traceability.  
2. **Bridge Layer**: Mirror/lock logic to represent AGRO on Sonic (wrapped AGRO).  
3. **Sonic Layer**: Marketplace, staking/liquidity pools using wrapped AGRO.  
4. **Relayer**: Watches Hedera events and mints/burns wrapped tokens on Sonic.

## Core Features
- Tokenized farming rewards on Hedera  
- Cross-chain value representation on Sonic  
- Scalable AgroMarket & liquidity pools  
- Traceability via both chains  

## Tech Stack
- Hedera HTS  
- Sonic (EVM layer)  
- Bridge/Relayer service  
- GitHub + DoraHacks  

## Getting Started
1. Checkout this branch: `sonic-integration`  
2. Update `AgroTokenSpec.md` with cross-chain parameters.  
3. Prototype the relayer watching Hedera and minting wrapped AGRO on Sonic.
